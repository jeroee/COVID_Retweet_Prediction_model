# COVID19 Retweet Prediction
Predictive model to predict number of retweets based on tweet.
Current code in our files (main.ipynb and model.py) are implemented for the setup for our best performing model.
Hyperparameters and features can be changed according to the report to replicate the experimented models.

## Installation

```bash
cd Dataset
bash raw_dataset.sh
